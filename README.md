3.	Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.

JavaScript Code
The JavaScript code for the Snake Game is contained in the script.js file. Here's a brief explanation of its key components:
•	Game Initialization: The game initializes by setting up the game board, initializing the snake's position and direction, placing the food randomly on the board, and setting the initial score to 0.
•	Game Loop: The core functionality of the game is based on a game loop implemented using the setInterval() function. This loop continuously updates the game state and redraws the game board on the screen.
•	Snake Movement: The snake's movement is controlled using the arrow keys. The direction of the snake is updated based on the key pressed by the player.
•	Collision Detection: The code checks for collisions between the snake and the boundaries of the game board or its own body. If a collision is detected, the game is over, and the loop stops.
•	Food Consumption: When the snake's head collides with a food item, it "consumes" the food, grows longer, and the player's score is increased.
•	Game Over and Restart: When the game ends due to a collision, a "Game Over" message is displayed, and the player can restart the game by clicking the "Play Snake" button.
CSS File
The CSS styles for the Snake Game are defined in the style.css file. Here's an overview of its structure and purpose:
•	Layout: The CSS file defines the overall layout of the game board and other elements. It sets the dimensions and positioning of the game container and centers it on the screen.
•	Colors and Styling: Various CSS styles are applied to create an attractive and visually appealing interface. You can find styles for the snake, food, score display, game over message, and the play button.
•	Animations: The CSS file contains animations for the snake's movement and transitions for smooth visual effects.
•	Responsiveness: The game interface is designed to be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes and orientations.
•	Background Image: The CSS file may include a background image for the game board, adding to the game's aesthetics.
Customization
You can customize the game by modifying the JavaScript code and CSS styles. In the JavaScript code, you can tweak game mechanics, add power-ups, or implement additional features. In the CSS file, you can adjust colors, sizes, positions, and animations to create a unique look for the game.
